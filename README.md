# NEXUS ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics)

NEXUS ICE is a secure data transfer protocol designed to facilitate fast and intercept-resistant communication between two endpoints. It ensures military-grade security while providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All data transferred through NEXUS ICE is encrypted end-to-end using state-of-the-art encryption algorithms.
  
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** NEXUS ICE employs the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to establish secure communication channels between sender and receiver.

- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Public-private key pairs are utilized for asymmetric encryption, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

- **Tamper-Resistant Signatures:** Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of transferred files, preventing tampering during transit.

- **Dynamic Token Generation:** NEXUS ICE dynamically generates tokens for sender and receiver identification, enhancing security and usability.

## Security Grade

NEXUS ICE provides military-grade security, ensuring that data transferred through the protocol is resistant to interception and tampering. It utilizes industry-standard encryption techniques and protocols to safeguard sensitive information.

## Usage

To use NEXUS ICE, follow these simple steps:

1. **Generate Tokens:** Each endpoint generates a unique token using the provided `Script.ConstructToken()` method.

2. **Exchange Tokens:** Share the generated tokens securely with the intended communication partner.

3. **Initiate Transfer:**
   - Sender: Use the `/send` command followed by the path to the file you wish to send.
   - Receiver: Use the `/receive` command to receive and save the transferred file.

4. **Follow Prompts:** Follow the on-screen prompts to enter necessary information such as file paths and token verification.
